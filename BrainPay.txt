So, after [creating a few Chrome Extensions](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/search-extensions/tpidev) I finally got to the meat of what I set out to do.
Combining my previous extensions focusing on balance checking, creating transactions and brainwallets, I created [BrainPay](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tps-brainpay/aihogeigcnkcklfaljfimkefkmbmlomi).
This cool extension lets you access your money stored in a brainwallet from a small popup and send payments to anyone without exposing your private keys outside of the extension.
That's right - no more keeping your wallet.dat secure, no more storing long gibberish URLs, and no more letting other people keep your money "safe" for you in eWallets.
Finally, your coins are both secure and easy to access for you.

I got the idea for this extension from a fellow Bitcoiner that I met at a local Bitcoin Meetup. He is working on an interesting idea that uses the same technology I presented here for a bigger purpose,
but I won't be going into that over here.

So, lets talk about the features the extension has:

* It automatically tracks the balance of your brainwallet address if you wish
* It can fetch all Bitcoin addresses present in your current tab with just one button - you no longer have to manually copy the addresses over
* You can send money to any number of addresses at once
* When you are ready to pay, you just input your brainwallet passphrase and decide whether it is compressed or not (yes, we support compressed addresses for those people that are concerned about the blockchain ;) )
* The app fetches your unspent transactinos from blockchain.info, creates an appropriate transaction and presents it to you for either later use (both as JSON and raw), or to be sent imidietly
* Your passphrase or private key never leave the extension

I hope you will enjoy this Chrome Extension. Source code is available [here](https://github.com/ThePiachu/TPs-BrainPay) so you can review it and make sure we don't send your sensitive information anywhere.
If you are also worried about our future updates being used to steal your money, again just use the source code and after review import it into your browser that way.
Nobody can automatically update your apps if they are imported like that through a developer mode.
And as always - create a new and secure brainwallet password for this new extension. Keep your cold storage safe while your spiffy new hot brainwallet handles the change ;).
